Notes for Release 3.2

The GridPACK applications directory was significantly restructured to eliminate
duplicate codes. The power grid applications now serve as test codes for the
corresponding application modules. There are no separate test codes for the
application modules. The online user manual has also been restructured to
reflect the changes in directory structure. More test problems have been
included with the existing applications so that users have a ready-made set of
test calculations reflecting a range of problem sizes. These are automatically
installed in the application directories when GridPACK is built. GridPACK still
runs only small test cases if the test suite is run.

The PTI33 parser for parsing PSS/E version 33 formatted files has been updated
to include more v33 parameters. It has also been verified against simulations
based on the v23 formatted input. The v33 parser has also been updated so that
it handles composite loads correctly. A command is available that can be used to
decompose a composite load into extra buses and branches used in dynamic
simulation.

The dynamic simulation module has been modified to handle composite loads
correctly.

The Kalman filter dynamic state estimation module has been added to the GridPACK
applications directory. This module is still poorly scaling and slows down
significantly for large problem sizes. However, it is available for users that
are interested in trying it out.

A new directory called "scripts" has been added to the source directory. This
contains build scripts that have been used to build the third-party libraries
used in GridPACK on different platforms. These scripts can serve as a starting
point for builds on users systems.

A new build using Personal Package Archives (PPA) has been added to the
GridPACK build. This build can be used on Ubuntu systems to create a working
copy of the entire GridPACK framework (including third-party library
dependencies) with just a few commands.

In addition to the above changes, minor bug fixes and performance improvements
have been added to the GridPACK framework.
