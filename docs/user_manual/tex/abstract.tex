\textbf{Abstract}:
This document is designed to provide an in-depth description of the GridPACK$\mathrm{{}^{TM}}$ framework and the software modules contained within it. In combination with the Doxygen-based documentation on the GridPACK webpage, users and application developers should have a complete description of the framework components and how to use them. The applications area in the source code directory, as well as the GridPACK modules and components, provide additional examples of how GridPACK can be used to create power grid applications. However, if there are still questions on GridPACK, users should feel free to contact the GridPACK development team.
